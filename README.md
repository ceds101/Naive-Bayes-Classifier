# Naive Bayes Classifier
Exercise 2 is creating a Naive Bayes Classifier

Exercise 2A - HAM and SPAM
--------------------------

### Data Preparation
#### 1. Renaming of files 
Renamed the EMAIL files by appending an extension of `.ham` or `.spam`. We implemented a script `email_utils.py` in `utils` folder. The script appends the filename of the email with `.ham` or `.spam` using the index file provided by the dataset `trec07p`.

#### 2. Relocating of files
The renamed EMAIL files are relocated in `trec07p_clean` this is done by the `email_utils.py` script

#### 3. Preparing data for Training and Testing
